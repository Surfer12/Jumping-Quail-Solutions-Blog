# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meta-Alignment Checker is a comprehensive audit and introspection system for recursive neuro-symbolic AI architectures. It provides operational transparency, meta-alignment assurance, and trust modeling capabilities to ensure AI systems maintain alignment with intended goals and ethical constraints throughout recursive operations. The system combines symbolic validation, neural pattern analysis, and Bayesian trust modeling to create a robust framework for AI safety and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI system developer, I want a meta-alignment evaluation framework, so that I can ensure my recursive neuro-symbolic agents maintain alignment with intended goals and ethical constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recursive AI agent begins operation THEN the system SHALL initialize meta-alignment monitoring with baseline trust scores
2. WHEN an evaluation pass is triggered THEN the system SHALL execute all configured alignment checks and record results with confidence scores
3. WHEN alignment drift is detected THEN the system SHALL log the violation and trigger appropriate recovery policies
4. IF trust score drops below threshold THEN the system SHALL increase symbolic validation weight and alert operators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time trust modeling and feedback loops, so that I can monitor and respond to alignment issues before they cause system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recursive operations execute THEN the system SHALL continuously update trust scores based on symbolic-neural consistency
2. WHEN trust variance exceeds configured thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger drift monitoring alerts
3. WHEN recovery policies are activated THEN the system SHALL reweight validation parameters and replay symbolic traces
4. IF cognitive misalignment is detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate penalties and log causation chains

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want comprehensive logging and traceability of alignment decisions, so that I can analyze system behavior and improve alignment mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN alignment evaluations occur THEN the system SHALL record detailed logs with timestamps, confidence scores, and decision rationales
2. WHEN symbolic reasoning chains execute THEN the system SHALL maintain full trace attribution for audit purposes
3. WHEN violations occur THEN the system SHALL capture complete causation chains and context for forensic analysis
4. IF evaluation patterns indicate systematic issues THEN the system SHALL generate summary reports with trend analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit-grade documentation and reproducible evaluations, so that I can verify system compliance with safety and ethical standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluations are performed THEN the system SHALL generate SHA256 snapshots for reproducibility verification
2. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete evaluation histories with integrity attestation
3. WHEN licensing compliance is checked THEN the system SHALL verify authorship citation and license requirements
4. IF external audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL export evaluation data in standardized formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want flexible export and visualization capabilities, so that I can integrate alignment checking into existing development and monitoring workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration is required THEN the system SHALL support multiple export formats including JSON, YAML, and structured logs
2. WHEN visualization is needed THEN the system SHALL provide graph representations of alignment pipelines and trust flows
3. WHEN real-time monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL support live web inspector interfaces
4. IF custom integrations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide extensible APIs for third-party tool integration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a safety engineer, I want configurable thresholds and recovery policies, so that I can customize alignment checking behavior for different risk profiles and operational contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL validate threshold values and policy definitions
2. WHEN threshold violations occur THEN the system SHALL execute configured recovery policies automatically
3. WHEN policy effectiveness is evaluated THEN the system SHALL track recovery success rates and adjustment recommendations
4. IF emergency conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL execute failsafe procedures and notify operators immediately

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide automated Java code quality improvements, focusing on modern best practices for null handling, functional programming patterns, and cleaner code structure. The primary focus is on identifying and refactoring legacy null-checking patterns to use `Optional` and other modern Java idioms, making code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want the system to automatically identify and suggest replacements for ternary null checks with Optional patterns, so that my code becomes more readable and follows modern Java best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters a ternary operator with null checks (e.g., `value == null ? defaultValue : transform(value)`) THEN it SHALL suggest replacing it with `Optional.ofNullable(value).map(transform).orElse(defaultValue)`
2. WHEN the system detects repeated variable names in ternary expressions THEN it SHALL flag this as a code smell and suggest Optional refactoring
3. WHEN the system finds complex nested ternary expressions with null checks THEN it SHALL recommend Optional chaining patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want the system to detect imperative null-checking if-else blocks and suggest functional Optional alternatives, so that my code follows a more functional programming style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters if-else blocks that only check for null and assign values THEN it SHALL suggest Optional.ofNullable().map().orElse() patterns
2. WHEN the system finds multiple sequential null checks THEN it SHALL recommend Optional chaining with multiple map() operations
3. IF an if-else block contains complex logic beyond simple null checking THEN the system SHALL NOT suggest Optional replacement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want the system to identify potentially error-prone null handling patterns, so that I can prevent NullPointerExceptions and improve code safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects repeated method calls in null checks (e.g., `obj.getValue() == null ? default : obj.getValue().transform()`) THEN it SHALL flag this as potentially unsafe and suggest Optional caching
2. WHEN the system finds chained method calls without null safety THEN it SHALL recommend Optional chaining patterns
3. WHEN the system encounters collection null checks THEN it SHALL suggest `Optional.ofNullable(collection).map(Collection::copyOf).orElse(emptyCollection())` patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want the system to provide explanations for why Optional patterns are better than traditional null checks, so that I can understand the benefits and learn best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system suggests an Optional refactoring THEN it SHALL provide a brief explanation of the benefits (readability, safety, functional style)
2. WHEN the system detects anti-patterns THEN it SHALL explain the specific problems with the current approach
3. WHEN the system suggests complex Optional chains THEN it SHALL break down the transformation step by step

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Java developer, I want the system to handle edge cases and provide appropriate warnings when Optional might not be the best solution, so that I don't over-apply the pattern inappropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters performance-critical code sections THEN it SHALL warn about potential Optional overhead
2. IF a null check is part of a larger conditional with business logic THEN the system SHALL NOT suggest Optional replacement
3. WHEN the system detects Optional being used in fields or method parameters THEN it SHALL warn against these anti-patterns
